							<h3>Industry Overview</h3>
							<p>The popularity of outdoor activities and technological advancements have led to a rapid growth of the outdoor recreation application industry. The COVID-19 pandemic has further fueled this growth as people seek safe and socially distant activities. Valued at USD 10.5 billion in 2019, the global market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.0% from 2020 to 2027. North America and Europe currently dominate the market, but Asia Pacific is expected to witness the highest growth rate due to increasing disposable incomes, growing interest in outdoor recreation, and adoption of technology.</p>

							<p>● Moderate to high threat of new entrants due to low barriers to entry.
							<br>● High threat of substitutes from alternative leisure activities and traditional methods of finding information about outdoor activities.
							<br>● Low supplier power due to the abundance of data sources and multiple providers of equipment and supplies.
							<br>● High buyer power due to a wide range of options, easily comparing prices and quality.
							<br>● Highly competitive, established brands have advantages over new companies.</p>

							<h1>Limitation and Future work</h1>
							<p>The outdoor recreation application industry faces significant challenges in terms of inclusivity, diversity, sustainability, and versatility. It has become apparent that the industry fails to adequately serve users from diverse backgrounds, including individuals with disabilities. Sustainability is often overlooked in the design and development of these applications, and the lack of versatile applications for various sports creates inconvenience for users who have to download multiple apps.
                            <br><br>
                            This project presents an opportunity to survey the outdoor recreation application industry, develop a business model canvas, and create a low-fidelity prototype for the ChooseAdventure application. The next step involves testing the low-fidelity prototype, gathering user feedback, and continuing development of the mid-fidelity prototype. This iterative process will culminate in the creation of the high-fidelity prototype, followed by user testing before final product development.</p>
                            <em>What I learned?</em>
                            <p>I have gained valuable insights into the integration of marketing and UX design strategies. I have learned how these two disciplines can work together synergistically to create successful products and experiences.</p>
                            <em>What I did well?</em>
                            <p> I have acquired a holistic approach to product development, where user-centered design principles are aligned with strategic marketing goals. This integrated approach has equipped me with valuable skills and knowledge to create products that not only meet user needs but also effectively communicate their value to the target market.</p>
                            <em>What could be improve?</em>
                            <p>I could have delved deeper into the specific concerns and requirements of users from diverse backgrounds, particularly those with disabilities. This would have allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of their needs and enabled the development of inclusive features within the application.</p>

						<h3>● Task 1: Creating a post in the community section</h3>
						<p>Overall, it is confusing that the user is unable to create a post from the Community section itself and must go through the activity track instead. To add another obstacle, it is also not clear which activities will end with an option to create a post once finished. Ideally, there should be a way for the user to create a post within the Community section.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>● Task 2: Finding an article on gratitude to read</h3>
						<p>A Happify user uses the Happify Daily section in this app to search for and view articles and video clips on topics of their choice. Some confusion exists regarding this exercise. First, the rainbow icon in the homepage navigation bar is not indicative of “articles,” or in this case, more often than not, video clips. Next, if the user wants to navigate to the articles section of the app from their account page, there is a lot of text for them to scan to find the “happify daily” text. Ideally, there should be a stronger indicator icon for the homepage navigation bar, and an easier way to find the “happify daily” page from the user’s account page.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>● Task 3: Complete a task given by the application</h3>
						<p>The user uses the Instant Play section on the app to complete the daily emotional fitness training that will help the user gain happiness skills, and gain further insight into positive emotion and life satisfaction scores. The user gets 6 training options to work on. The application allows the user flexibility to choose desired tasks by giving good recommendations and guidelines to help the user select the tasks. The user can rate the experience, post photos, and write a journal after completing a task. The user can share the journals with other users and receive likes and comments. The good feature about this section of the application is the flexibility for the user to keep the recorded tasks private if the user prefers not to share them with the public. The two problems that I see are the repeated recommendations that the application gives to help the user select a task. There is no time tracking or deadline for the task, which I can see that some users might prefer that option.</p>

					<h3>● Test Object 1: Are users able to easily get started by creating an account?</h3>
					<p>During Task 1, all 5 participants were able to create an account on the app without any issues. This was rated as very easy by all participants. Two of the users expressed confusion at the end of the task as they were expecting a conclusive notification confirming that their account had been successfully created.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>● Test objective 2: Are users able to easily find a track that resonates with them and begin it?</h3>
					<p>During Task 2, all 5 participants were able to successfully find and start a free track on the app. The median score for the task's difficulty was 4 out of 5, indicating that it was relatively easy for the users to complete. Some users felt overwhelmed by the amount of information and assessment questions presented to them at the beginning of the track, despite completing the task successfully.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>● Test objective 3: Do users feel satisfied when they complete the track activities?</h3>
					<p>During Task 3, 4 out of 5 participants were able to complete the first activity in their selected track on the app. The median score for the task's ease of use was 4 out of 5, indicating that it was relatively easy for the users to complete. 3 out of 4 users who played an interactive balloon game during the activity found it confusing as it had no clear end, and disliked the popup ads for the Happify premium subscription. Two participants found the activity directions vague, and two other participants noted that the activities were time-consuming and lacked functionality for long-term use for self-care.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>● Test objective 4: Are users able to easily create, edit, or delete posts and comments on their timeline and community feed?</h3>
					<p>During Task 4, only 3 out of 5 participants were able to successfully post their activity in the community section of the app. The median score for the task's ease of use was 1 out of 5, indicating that it was challenging for the users to complete. For 3 participants, there was no indication of where or how to post the activity to the community section.
					<br><br>During Task 5, only 1 out of 5 participants were able to successfully edit the text in their post, and the median score for the task's ease of use was 1 out of 5. Two participants were not able to attempt this task because they were unable to complete Task 4. Additionally, two participants found it difficult to locate where and how to edit the post content.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>● Test objective 5: Do users know where to find the articles and video entries within the Happify Daily section in order to engage with the content? </h3>
					<p>During Task 6, all 5 participants were able to successfully find content to view in the Happify Daily section and share it with a friend on Facebook. The median score for the task's ease of use was 4 out of 5, indicating that it was relatively easy for the users to complete. Four out of five participants completed the entire task within 2 minutes or less.</p>
