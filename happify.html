										<p>Our team embarked on a comprehensive comparative study of the Happify application and website to identify areas that required improvement. The principal goal of this study was to assist Happify in enhancing long-term user engagement. To achieve this objective, we utilized various evaluation methods, including heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough, and usability testing, to identify any usability issues. Our primary focus was to provide a detailed analysis of the usability issues identified during the evaluation process, highlighting their severity and potential impact on user engagement, and provide actionable recommendations on how Happify could address these issues and improve the overall user experience.</p>

								<h1>Phase 1</h1>
								<p>We conducted a usability test that utilized both cognitive walkthroughs and heuristic evaluations to assess the system's usability. During the cognitive walkthroughs, we simulated the thought processes of users as they completed specific tasks to evaluate the system's usability. In addition, we employed expert evaluators to analyze the system based on established design principles of heuristic evaluation to identify usability issues.</p>

								<h3>Application</h3>
								<p>The Happify application's user interface has ambiguous icons in the bottom navigation bar, inconsistent use of vector graphics and photographs resulting in visual overload, and inconsistency in the use of back arrows. There is also a lack of standardization and consistent formatting in text size, and the app lacks the ability to identify nonsensical answers. Additionally, the app can be wordy and dense and lacks shortcut features. Activities also lack clear indications of their type until initiation, and editing comments in the community section is impossible. The "Get Inspired" page uses an infinite scroll feature, making it difficult for users to stop scrolling, and the drop-down menu at the top of the section is labeled "show articles," which could be confusing for users given that the majority of the content comprises videos or images.</p>

								<span>Heuristic Evaluation</span>
								<h3>Website</h3>
								<p>The website has an overwhelming design, with multiple colors, background images, graphics, and inconsistent typography design. The content is challenging to scan and digest due to the busy design and significant amount of content. We noticed two buttons for initiating the process with slightly different languages leading to the same link, suggesting a need for consistency in wording. The navbar includes a link to Happify Health, a different version of the product tailored for businesses, but there is no option to return to the previous site. The footer of each page in Happify Health appears misaligned when browsing on mobile devices. The three links on the Jobs page in Happify Health lead to the same context and job descriptions, indicating repeating content. To improve the user experience, we suggest organizing the footer in a similar manner to the main Happify website and categorizing the links on the Jobs page.<p>

								<h3>Task 1: Creating a post in the community section</h3>
								<p>There could potentially be confusion among users regarding the process of creating a post in the Happify Community section. Users are required to go through the activity track to create a post, which can be a confusing process. It is unclear which activities offer the option to create a post once completed, adding further obstacles for the user. In our opinion, it would be ideal if Happify provided a way for users to create a post directly within the Community section to simplifying the process and making it more user-friendly.</p>

								<h3>Task 2: Finding an article on gratitude to read</h3>
								<p>We have observed the way users would access the Happify Daily section of the app to browse articles and video clips on various topics of their interest. We have noted that some confusion could exist among users regarding this exercise. Specifically, we have found that the rainbow icon in the homepage navigation bar is not sufficiently representative of "articles." Furthermore, we have identified that it might be difficult for users to navigate to the articles section of the app from the account page, as users need to scan through a lot of text to find the "happify daily" link. Therefore, we recommend that Happify should consider using a stronger indicator icon for the homepage navigation bar and provides an easier way for users to access the "happify daily" page from their account page.</p>

								<h3>Task 3: Complete a task given by the application</h3>
								<p>We conducted an evaluation of the Instant Play section of the app, which enables users to complete daily emotional fitness training and improve their happiness skills, as well as gain insight into positive emotion and life satisfaction scores. The application provides the user with six training options to choose from, with good recommendations and guidelines to assist them in selecting tasks. After completing a task, the user can rate their experience, post photos, and write a journal, which can be shared with other users who can like and comment on the post. The application offers users the flexibility to keep their recorded tasks private if they prefer. However, we noticed two issues with this section of the application. Firstly, the repeated recommendations provided by the application to assist users in selecting a task can be frustrating. Secondly, the application lacks a time tracking or deadline feature, which some users may prefer.

                        <h3>● Improve Visibility and Usability of the Navigation bar</h3>
<!--						  <p>To improve user navigation and app usability, it is recommended to make the navigation bar more visible and use easily interpretable icons. The current transparent background hampers visibility, making it difficult for users to differentiate it from the content. Unclear associations between icons and their respective pages add to cognitive load and require users to remember non-intuitive connections. Addressing these issues will enhance user efficiency and reduce frustration during app navigation.</p>-->
						      <ul>
							     <li>Change the background to a solid color with full opacity, using the primary orange color consistent with the app's design.</li>
							     <li>Make the icons white to ensure better contrast and visibility.</li>
                                 <li>Add clear labels below each icon to provide explicit navigation indications, such as "Home," "Activities," "Resources," and "Community."</li>
                                 <li>Redesign the navigation bar icons for better representation. Consider using a puzzle piece to signify activities, a book or video screen to indicate where videos and articles can be found.</li>
						      </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h3>● Optimizing Article Browsing: Improved Filtering, Navigation, and Usability</h3>
<!--						  <p>The "Get Inspired" page's infinite scroll lacks a clear endpoint, diminishing users' control and making it hard to stop scrolling. The large number of articles without an endpoint and the absence of a back-to-top button add to usability challenges.</p>-->
						      <ul>
							     <li>Add a search bar at the top for users to filter articles by keywords.</li>
							     <li>Limit the display to 50 articles per page to avoid overwhelming users.</li>
                                 <li>Clearly indicate the number of articles already scrolled through on each page.</li>
                                 <li>Provide filter options for sorting articles by date, rating, and popularity.</li>
                                 <li>Show the endpoint of the article list, similar to Google search results.</li>
                                 <li>Include a button for users to easily access the first and last page with a single click.</li>
						      </ul>
                        <br>
				        <h3>● Simplified Profile Page</h3>
<!--						  <p>The "More" page currently presents dense text content, which can make it challenging for users to locate information quickly and accurately. Furthermore, this page duplicates content already available in the user's profile information and the homepage navigation bar, rather than offering additional or unique content.</p>-->
						      <ul>
							     <li>Change the "More" page to a “Profile” page.</li>
							     <li>Remove all other sections as they are readily accessible on the homepage navigation bar.</li>
							     <li>In the profile page, implement clickable icons or sections to facilitate effortless scanning and quick identification of desired sections for users.</li>

<!--                                  <p>Out of 5 participants, 3 were able to successfully complete the task. However, 3 participants, including one who completed it, expressed confusion during the process.</p>-->

                                          <li>Improve the post creation process by enabling users to create posts at the end of all activities, rather than limiting it to specific activities (e.g., games).</li>
                                          <li>Enhance clarity by modifying the language of the call-to-action (CTA) button from "Happify It" to something like "Create Post" to clearly indicate the purpose of the action.</li>
                                          <li>Change the pencil icon on the Community page to a more suitable icon, such as a sticky note, as participants confused the current icon as a means to create a new post.</li>

                                         <li>Replace the small button with three dots at the bottom right corner. Instead, use text that clearly indicates its purpose, such as "Edit," making it more apparent to users where they can go to edit their post.</li>

                                         <li>Remove popup ads during the activity to minimize distractions. Note: Popup ads only appear for iPhone users.</li>
                                         <li>Allow users to exit the activity earlier if desired.</li>

<!--                                  <p>Some users found the extra information and redundancy confusing when personalizing their track with an additional assessment.</p>-->
                                      <ul>
                                         <li>Revise the questions in the "Help Me Choose" section to avoid repetition with the assessment section during account creation. Alternatively, consider adding a section with selected tracks tailored to user needs in the "Explore Tracks" section.</li>
                                         <li>Add two buttons for users to choose between "Starting a Track" or "See how Happify Works." Also, include an exit button on the top of the "How Happify Works" page for users to leave the page at any time.</li>

									<h3>Method</h3>
									<p>Our team employed a within-subjects test design, conducted on the <a href="https://www.loop11.com/">Loop11</a> user testing platform, which allowed us to ask pre-screening questions, record participants' screens as they completed all tasks, and ask debriefing questions, all in one place. In an unmoderated test, we presented nine participants with the task of finding an article on the topic of mindfulness on both the <a href="https://www.happify.com">Happify</a> and <a href="https://www.headspace.com">Headspace</a> websites.</p>

									<h3>Test Objectives</h3>
									<p>After conducting an initial review and testing of the Happify app, our aim was to compare the navigation patterns of users on the Happify website with that of a similar resource. Additionally, we aimed to gather comparative data on the difficulty of tasks, the ease of use of the website, and the overall satisfaction of the users.</p>

									<h3>Tasks</h3>
									<p>As our objective was to gain a better understanding of how users locate specific articles on both websites, we assigned the following task to our participants. This task allowed us to observe how participants navigated to the page and how they searched for a specific article.</p>
									<ul class="list-group">
		  							<li class="list-group-item">You’re not very familiar with the topic of mindfulness and are interested in learning more. Find an article that describes what it is or how to become more mindful in any area of your life.</li>

								<div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-0 animate-box">
									<h4>Raw data</h4>
									<p>After each participant completed the assigned task, we asked them to rate the task difficulty, website ease of use, and enjoyment of using the website. We utilized a Likert scale to rate the level of task difficulty and ease of use for the website, with 1 indicating "very difficult" and 5 indicating "very easy." Additionally, we used a similar scale with 1 representing "not at all" and 5 indicating "very much" to rate the participants' enjoyment while using each site.
									<br>We use <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">RStudio</a> to perform pair t-test to find out the statistical differences between two sets of data.

									<h1>Limitations and Future Works</h1>
                                    <em>What I learned?</em>
                                    <p>I acquired valuable experiences and expertise in conducting various usability evaluation methods, including heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough, and usability testing. I developed skills in facilitating testing sessions, posing relevant questions, and capturing valuable data and observations. These experiences equipped me with the necessary knowledge and abilities to evaluate and improve the usability of products.</p>
                                    <em>What I did well?</em>
                                    <p>I actively engaged in teamwork, fostering a positive and supportive environment. I effectively communicated ideas, actively listened to others, and openly shared my knowledge and expertise.</p>
                                    <em>What could be improve?</em>
                                    <p>During the course of this project, it became evident that none of the team members possessed strong data analytic knowledge. Recognizing this as an opportunity for personal development, I volunteered to take on the responsibility of handling the data analytics aspect of the project. Through this experience, I realized that there is still considerable room for improvement in my data analytics skills. This recognition has emphasized the importance of seeking further learning and practice to enhance my proficiency in data analysis as a UX/UI designer.</p>
