												<h2 class="about-head">Get to know me!</h2>
												<p>My name is Natalie Natthisa Sroisudaratna, from Thailand. At a young age, my family introduced me to the quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: 'Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and make a trail.' This quote inspiring me to embrace my originality, encourage independent thinking, stay open-minded, and pioneer new directions in life. One significant milestone in my life was receiving a scholarship to study in the US during high school. This opportunity pushed my boundaries, fostering independence and exposing me to academic achievements and diverse career prospects. As my passion for photography deepened, I found myself contemplating the purpose and benefits of my work in relation to my family, society, and the world at large.
                                                <br><br>
                                                I yearned for more than just self-expression or storytelling; I wanted to make a tangible impact on people's lives and extend it toward global well-being. This realization led me to recognize the power of merging my creative passion with the realm of science and technology. The motivation to become part of a dedicated force that creates profound and positive change drives me to pursue a career as a UX/UI designer. In this ever-evolving field, I see endless possibilities for innovation and progress. My ultimate goal is to contribute to a world where technology and products not only enable but also empower people, making their lives more efficient, sustainable, and enjoyable. Additionally, I aim to express creativity through art, share knowledge, and foster collaboration and learning.

												<h2 class="about-head">Human Computer Interaction</h2>
												<p>My journey into the field of HCI began when I worked as a social media manager and became involved in a website redesign project. It was during this experience that I discovered the profound influence of user experience on various domains, ranging from technology and product design to marketing, education, and healthcare. The impact fascinated me and sparked a deep passion for UX/UI design, ultimately leading me to pursue a master's degree in HCI.
                                                <br><br>
                                                Throughout my college years, I found immense fulfillment in addressing complex problems and overcoming usability challenges to create functional, intuitive, and inclusive products that cater to individuals from diverse backgrounds, ages, and abilities. My unwavering dedication to enhancing the usability and accessibility of products and services, combined with my love for design, empowers me to empathize, learn, and grow. I am fully committed to achieving the best possible outcomes in my current and future career as a UX/UI designer. I firmly believe that my work can have a positive impact on people's lives by making technology more accessible and usable for everyone.

												<h2 class="about-head">Photo</h2>
												<p>As a child, my mother captured my days through photography, a medium she never had the chance to experience in her own youth. I remember being fascinated by the transformation of photo negatives into beautiful images as I looked through them. Thanks to my mother's passion for art and her support in nurturing my creative talents, I had the opportunity to explore photography at a young age.
												<br><br>Participating in a darkroom workshop left a profound impact on me. It was there that I learned the process of transforming negatives into photographs. The moment of seeing an image slowly appear on the paper was truly magical. Over the years, photography has become an integral part of my identity and a powerful means of expressing my creativity. It allows me to tell stories and capture the artistry present in the world around me. Through my lens, I both honor the art my mother introduced me to and share my unique perspective with others.

																<h2 class="about-head">Personal Interests</h2>
																<p>During my high school and college years, I discovered a passion for what many consider "extreme sports," which I wholeheartedly embraced. Engaging in these outdoor activities allows me to explore diverse locations, immerse myself in various cultures, experience different cuisines, and create valuable connections with individuals from various backgrounds. Through these sports, I have learned crucial life skills such as self-discipline, persistence, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. Additionally, they have deepened my respect for nature and the environment.
                                                                <br><br>
                                                                As I have become more proficient in climbing and scuba diving, I have gained confidence and self-esteem through volunteering as a divemaster candidate and organizing climbing events, where I share my knowledge and skills with others. The opportunity to continuously acquire new skills and share my passion for sports through teaching brings me immense joy. These experiences have sharpened my ability to assess risks, adapt to different situations, and establish trust as a leader, fostering patience and compassion along the way.
