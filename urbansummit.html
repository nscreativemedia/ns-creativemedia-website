										<p>The Urban Summit project exemplified the iterative process of prototype development, employing diverse strategies to create a mobile and smartwatch application that enhanced personal safety for individuals engaged in outdoor activities and fitness. The design process followed a structured approach, starting with the creation of individual sketches to explore and refine product ideas. Essential features were diligently identified, forming the foundation for developing personas and the initial prototype. A narrative digital prototype was created to visualize potential scenarios and refine the user experience. The mid-fidelity prototype was developed to test core features and gather user feedback, ultimately leading to the refinement of the high-fidelity prototype.</p>

							<h1>Conceptual Idea</h1>
							<p>We developed a mobile and satellite-based communication device to enhance user safety during outdoor activities and urban exploration. Our device included a mobile application and satellite communication capabilities, allowing users to send personalized messages to emergency contacts and services. The unique feature of our product was the ability to deliver tailored messages for effective communication in critical situations. By leveraging satellite technology, our device ensured reliable communication without relying on cellular signals. We explored two options for the device's configuration and channels:</p>

							<h3>Option 1 - Three Channels: Mobile, Smartwatch, Satellite Device</h3>
							<p>In this option, the satellite device had no screen and users could utilize the mobile device and smartwatch for messaging and accessing screen-dependent features. The smartwatch also monitored the user's physiological parameters like heart rate and temperature.</p>

                        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-0 animate-box">
							<h3>Option 2 - Two Channels: Mobile, Smartwatch</h3>
							<p>In this option, the smartwatch integrated satellite capabilities directly into its design. This eliminated the need for an extra device, as the satellite functionality became an integral part of the smartwatch.</p>

Each team member individually conducted 1-2 usability tests, taking on the roles of both moderator and observer.

Its well-designed letterforms and balanced proportions provide a comfortable reading experience for users. Font weights were used to convey visual hierarchy, emphasize important information, and create a balanced and visually appealing layout. Regular font weight was utilized in body text and general content to provide a clean and readable appearance for text that didn't require special attention. The medium font weight was employed in secondary text that needed to stand out more than regular text. Lastly, bold font weight was applied to headings, titles, and buttons to draw attention to important elements in the design. Consistency in font usage was maintained throughout the application to ensure a cohesive and harmonious visual experience.</p>

							<h1>Limitations and Futurework</h1>
							<em>What we learned?</em>
                            <p>Our team demonstrated a strong understanding of the importance of a structured design process. By starting with individual sketches and progressing through prototypes, our team was able to incorporate user feedback to refine the final design. This iterative approach allowed for continuous improvement and ensured that the product met the needs and preferences of the users.</p>
                            <em>What we did well?</em>
                            <p>Our team successfully implemented a variety of strategies for prototype development, including the creation of personas and the use of a narrative digital prototype. These techniques helped visualize potential scenarios and refine the user experience.  Our attention to visual consistency and clean design aesthetics improved the overall usability and accessibility of the application.</p>
                            <em>What could we improve?</em>
                            <p>One area for improvement is conducting further research on integrating satellite technology into the product. Understanding the operations and functionality of satellite systems will be crucial in seamlessly incorporating them into the application and accommodating the various activities of the users. This additional research will enhance the capabilities of the product and ensure it provides reliable and comprehensive safety features for outdoor activities.</p>
