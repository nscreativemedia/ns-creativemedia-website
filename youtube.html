									<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 animate-box">
										<p>In March 2021, YouTube launched a new feature, “Shorts,” to compete with TikTok and keep up with the demand for short-form videos during the pandemic. The interface of playing “Shorts'' videos is different from regular long videos on YouTube, which adds to the complexity of the YouTube experience. Since there is little research on this new feature, we aimed to evaluate the usability of ‘Shorts’ to fill this gap. The goal of the project is to conduct a thorough usability evaluation of YouTube, with the aim of providing recommendations to improve accessibility and better meet the needs of individuals who are blind or visually impaired.</p>

							<h1>Research</h1>
							<p>YouTube has since risen to be the second most visited website in the world, with more than 2.3 billion monthly users. The top three reasons for using YouTube are “need for help”, “to be entertained”, and “to learn something new.” It has also grown in use for individuals with disabilities. Despite being the second most visited website in the world, video content on YouTube is often inaccessible to individuals with disabilities, specifically the blind and visually impaired.</p>

							<h3>Audio Interaction</h3>
							<p>In a recent study, Hafiar et al. aimed to understand how visually impaired teenagers used the internet in everyday activities. They found that teenagers with disabilities used the internet similarly to teenagers who were sighted. The authors hypothesized that the reason why YouTube became so highly utilized was the potential for audio interaction. Senjam and Primo reported a similar result, finding that visually impaired individuals had similar levels of mainstream app use when compared to sighted individuals. Commonly used apps by their participants included YouTube for entertainment and accessing COVID-19 information. However, it should be noted that the visually impaired may face difficulties while using YouTube.</p>

							<h3>YouTube Video Accessibility</h3>
							<p>Many videos on YouTube are often found to have missing alternative text descriptions and inline audio descriptions or extended audio descriptions. Solutions that address these problems include services like “YouDescribe” which enables volunteers to add audio descriptions to YouTube videos. However, inexperienced volunteers did not always produce high-quality and informative descriptions and they struggled to keep pace with newly uploaded videos. Furthermore, since YouTube does not require content creators to provide alternative text descriptions or inline audio descriptions, individuals who are blind and visually impaired struggle to consistently find content they desire. Accessibility needs to be emphasized as the creation and distribution of user-generated videos continue to grow.</p>

							<h3>Problem Statements</h3>
							<p> The competitive forces, intensity, and attractiveness of the outdoor recreation application industry can be summarized using the Porter Model framework as follows:</p>
							<p>● In Liu et al. study of YouTube use, reported that users who were blind used trial and error approach to determine if a video was accessible to them which was time-consuming.
							<br>● Kadakia et al. found that content creators on YouTube lacked care or knowledge to include accessibility keyword terms resulting in barriers for users who were visually impaired.
							<br>● Senjam and Primo study of YouTube navigation with screen readers, found that participants who were blind reported several problem issues with navigation.
							<br>● In a recent 2022 study, several participants with visual impairment had trouble getting used to new interfaces with updates on YouTube.</p>

							<h3>Complicated Video Discovery Experience</h3>
							<p>The introduction of two video content formats on YouTube, including Shorts, has complicated the user experience for both sighted and visually impaired participants. Shorts, which is a new immersive feature that delivers mobile-first, bite-sized video content, presents a steep learning curve, particularly for those who are visually impaired, as it differs significantly from regular YouTube videos. The feature aims to engage users by auto-playing videos on a loop unless manually paused, which has caused confusion for some users. During task 4, participants, both sighted and visually impaired, were unsure whether to use the global search bar on the YouTube homepage to search for the Shorts video, with some mistakenly clicking on the Shorts feature first.</p>

							<h3>Not Easy to Control Video</h3>
							<p>All blind participants faced challenges accessing video player controls for both Shorts and regular videos. The automatic play feature of Shorts videos made it difficult for them to hear the screen reader. Participants expressed frustration and difficulties in using shortcut keys, such as pausing the video, with P5 mentioning the need to pop out the video to stop it. Additionally, P5 had trouble fast-forwarding and rewinding regular videos. In contrast, all sighted participants could navigate the controls with ease using the mouse.</p>

							<h3>Unintuitive Navigation</h3>
							<p>Participants who are blind encountered difficulties when navigating the YouTube website. They had trouble identifying errors and troubleshooting when they got lost on the page. The shortcut keys worked differently on the Shorts and regular videos page, which confused participants. They expected a similar shortcut key experience when browsing content on the same website. Some participants accidentally played new Shorts videos while trying to explore the screen freely on the Shorts video page. Furthermore, participants had difficulty locating the Shorts feature using screen reader shortcuts.</p>

							<h3>Inaccessible Video</h3>
							<p>The study found that inaccessible videos can be frustrating for participants who are blind and less appealing for sighted participants. Four blind participants failed to find the ingredients list in Task 2 because the content creator did not provide it in the description or transcripts. One sighted participant suggested that the creator should have included the list in the description, while another participant shared an app called YouDescribe that generates audio descriptions and helps individuals who are blind understand video content better.</p>

							<h1>Recommendations</h1>
							<p>Based on our findings, we came up with five main recommendations to make the YouTube website more accessible.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-12 col-md-offset-0 animate-box">
						<h3>● Simplify and demonstrate the website structure</h3>
						<p>One of the challenges for participants who are visually impaired was the website became more complicated when there were two types of video players.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Implement a separate search filter to distinguish Shorts videos from regular videos in search results.</li>
							<li>Utilize ARIA attributes to describe the purpose of the search bar, such as "search for regular and Shorts video," to inform visually-impaired users that it is a global utility.</li>
							<li>Ensure consistency between the shortcut keys for regular and Shorts videos to minimize cognitive load for visually-impaired users.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h3>● Redesign video player controls and fix the existing problem</h3>
						<p>Most blind participants had difficulty pausing videos due to malfunctioning shortcut keys in Shorts videos and forgetfulness in the regular videos. This finding supports Seo and Jung's study's first category of accessibility issues.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Rectify the malfunctioning pause shortcut keys (K key and spacebar) for Shorts videos, to enable users to pause videos without any inconvenience.</li>
							<li>Redesign the layout or reading order of video player controls for both Shorts and regular videos, to ensure that visually impaired users can use these controls efficiently, even if they forget the shortcuts.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h3>● Distinguish the Shorts from regular video clearly</h3>
						<p>Three of the participants who are blind could not identify which videos were Shorts. Two other participants who are blind stated that identifying these videos needed time and full attention.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Utilize ARIA to provide a label for the Shorts video, enabling screen readers to indicate to users that it is a Shorts video before reading its title.</li>
							<li>Relocate the Shorts label from the bottom-right corner of the video thumbnail to the video description area and ensure that it has sufficient contrast and size, making it more visible to users with low vision.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h3>● Improve system visibility and allow different ways to explore</h3>
						<p>The majority of participants who were visually impaired experienced difficulty in navigating the website, particularly when confronted with unexpected errors. The challenges related to navigation and the location of new features provide further corroboration for the results of a study conducted by Senjam and Primo in 2022.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Incorporate an accessibility feature that enables screen readers to search through all elements on the webpage.</li>
							<li>Conduct thorough testing with screen readers to identify and resolve issues related to bugs and conflicts with shortcut keys. This will ensure that users can navigate between the Shorts feature and homepage seamlessly, regardless of the shortcut keys they use.</li>
							<li>Avoid automatically opening elements without providing prior notification to the user. For instance, include a button that allows users to choose whether they want to open a new browser to log in to their account when they reach the input form in the comments section.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						<h3>● Encourage accessibility</h3>
						<p>It was observed that both participants with visual impairment and sighted participants resorted to the description section of regular videos to seek primary information. Participants with visual impairment found it challenging to determine the accessibility of the video without appropriate information in the description section.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Develop an accessibility feature that prompts content creators to include essential information about their videos, such as summaries and transcripts. Encourage creators to provide a video description after uploading their content.</li>
						</ul>

							<em>What we learned?</em>
                            <p>Blind participants had similar YouTube usage to sighted individuals, but they had lower computer usage to access the website. This difference in familiarity may have biased our data.

                            <em>What we did well?</em>
							<br>We successfully learned and implemented the use of screen readers during the usability test, showcasing our adaptability, self-teaching abilities, and great team collaboration.
                            <br><br>
                            <em>What could be improve?</em>
							<br>Collecting demographic information, such as age and location, could have provided additional insights into usage patterns. Technical issues during interviews, including sound and connectivity problems, posed challenges and caused delays. Conducting in-person testing would be advantageous in mitigating any issues related to Zoom functionality. Due to the small sample size, establishing statistical significance for some findings is challenging. Increasing the sample size in future research can address this limitation.</p>

							<p>The constraints of our study highlight specific areas that need to be explored in future research. It is advisable to consider a larger sample size and employ more standardized procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of YouTube's website browser for all users. It would be beneficial to resolve all technical issues before commencing the testing process to yield more accurate results. Conducting in-person testing would be advantageous in mitigating any issues related to Zoom functionality, resulting in more reliable data to analyze. Furthermore, it is essential to collect all pertinent demographic information to identify any discernible patterns.</p>

						<h3>● Task 1: Creating a post in the community section</h3>
						<p>Overall, it is confusing that the user is unable to create a post from the Community section itself and must go through the activity track instead. To add another obstacle, it is also not clear which activities will end with an option to create a post once finished. Ideally, there should be a way for the user to create a post within the Community section.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>● Task 2: Finding an article on gratitude to read</h3>
						<p>A Happify user uses the Happify Daily section in this app to search for and view articles and video clips on topics of their choice. Some confusion exists regarding this exercise. First, the rainbow icon in the homepage navigation bar is not indicative of “articles,” or in this case, more often than not, video clips. Next, if the user wants to navigate to the articles section of the app from their account page, there is a lot of text for them to scan to find the “happify daily” text. Ideally, there should be a stronger indicator icon for the homepage navigation bar, and an easier way to find the “happify daily” page from the user’s account page.</p>
						<br>
						<h3>● Task 3: Complete a task given by the application</h3>
						<p>The user uses the Instant Play section on the app to complete the daily emotional fitness training that will help the user gain happiness skills, and gain further insight into positive emotion and life satisfaction scores. The user gets 6 training options to work on. The application allows the user flexibility to choose desired tasks by giving good recommendations and guidelines to help the user select the tasks. The user can rate the experience, post photos, and write a journal after completing a task. The user can share the journals with other users and receive likes and comments. The good feature about this section of the application is the flexibility for the user to keep the recorded tasks private if the user prefers not to share them with the public. The two problems that I see are the repeated recommendations that the application gives to help the user select a task. There is no time tracking or deadline for the task, which I can see that some users might prefer that option.</p>

					<h3>● Test Object 1: Are users able to easily get started by creating an account?</h3>
					<p>During Task 1, all 5 participants were able to create an account on the app without any issues. This was rated as very easy by all participants. Two of the users expressed confusion at the end of the task as they were expecting a conclusive notification confirming that their account had been successfully created.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>● Test objective 2: Are users able to easily find a track that resonates with them and begin it?</h3>
					<p>During Task 2, all 5 participants were able to successfully find and start a free track on the app. The median score for the task's difficulty was 4 out of 5, indicating that it was relatively easy for the users to complete. Some users felt overwhelmed by the amount of information and assessment questions presented to them at the beginning of the track, despite completing the task successfully.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>● Test objective 3: Do users feel satisfied when they complete the track activities?</h3>
					<p>During Task 3, 4 out of 5 participants were able to complete the first activity in their selected track on the app. The median score for the task's ease of use was 4 out of 5, indicating that it was relatively easy for the users to complete. 3 out of 4 users who played an interactive balloon game during the activity found it confusing as it had no clear end, and disliked the popup ads for the Happify premium subscription. Two participants found the activity directions vague, and two other participants noted that the activities were time-consuming and lacked functionality for long-term use for self-care.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>● Test objective 4: Are users able to easily create, edit, or delete posts and comments on their timeline and community feed?</h3>
					<p>During Task 4, only 3 out of 5 participants were able to successfully post their activity in the community section of the app. The median score for the task's ease of use was 1 out of 5, indicating that it was challenging for the users to complete. For 3 participants, there was no indication of where or how to post the activity to the community section.
					<br><br>During Task 5, only 1 out of 5 participants were able to successfully edit the text in their post, and the median score for the task's ease of use was 1 out of 5. Two participants were not able to attempt this task because they were unable to complete Task 4. Additionally, two participants found it difficult to locate where and how to edit the post content.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>● Test objective 5: Do users know where to find the articles and video entries within the Happify Daily section in order to engage with the content? </h3>
					<p>During Task 6, all 5 participants were able to successfully find content to view in the Happify Daily section and share it with a friend on Facebook. The median score for the task's ease of use was 4 out of 5, indicating that it was relatively easy for the users to complete. Four out of five participants completed the entire task within 2 minutes or less.</p>
